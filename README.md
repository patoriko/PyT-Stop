# PyT-Stop

Pyt Stop is a racing game made using Python. Originally a racing game under another name, Pyt Stop was a high school assignment that I'm now continuing to try and improve. My end goal is to have create a game in which I can learn about a variety of aspects of game design, and game programming fundamentals.
